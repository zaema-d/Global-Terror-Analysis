# Global Terrorism Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) as part of a security/defense analysis task. The main objective is to identify the hot zones of terrorism and extract insightful security issues from the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the Global Terrorism Database, which can be accessed from the provided link. It consists of various attributes ranging from temporal data of incidents to details about the attacks, such as location, type, weapons used, and more.

## Objective

- Identify and visualize the hot zones of terrorism.
- Derive insightful security issues and trends from the data.

## Methodology

The analysis is performed using Python with libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization. Steps include:

1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Geographic Analysis: Identifying regions with high terrorism activities.
3. Temporal Analysis: Observing the trends and patterns over the years.
4. Type and Impact Analysis: Analyzing common attack types and their consequences.
5. Storyboarding: Presenting the findings in a coherent and insightful manner.

## File Descriptions

- `global_terrorism_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all the analysis and visualizations.
- `global_terrorism.csv`: The Global Terrorism Database file.

## Results

The findings will be presented as visualizations and storyboards, highlighting the key areas of concern and providing a narrative on the global state of terrorism.

## How to Run

1. Ensure Python and the necessary libraries are installed.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook `global_terrorism_analysis.ipynb`.
